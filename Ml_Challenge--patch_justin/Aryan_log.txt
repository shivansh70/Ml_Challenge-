1. Resolved the issue of black images (changed the actual format to jpeg).
2. Changed the multiprocessing pool to minimum of 10 and the count of CPUs available since the system hangs during the download of image, to ensure smooth download.
3. Made changes in create_placeholder_image and download_image function.
4. Added some new libraries to ensure smooth functioning.
